Pungi is a distribution compose tool.

Composes are release snapshots that contain release deliverables such as:

* installation trees
  - RPMs
  - repodata
  - comps
* (bootable) ISOs
* kickstart trees
  - anaconda images
  - images for PXE boot

```
The name Pungi comes from the instrument used to charm snakes. Anaconda being the software Pungi was manipulating, and anaconda being a snake, led to the referential naming.

The first name, which was suggested by Seth Vidal, was FIST, Fedora Installation <Something> Tool.
That name was quickly discarded and replaced with Pungi.

There was also a bit of an inside joke that when said aloud, it could sound like punji, which is a sharpened stick at the bottom of a trap. Kind of like software…
