Progress notification
*********************

*Pungi* has the ability to emit notification messages about progress
and general status of the compose. These can be used to e.g. send
messages to *fedmsg*. This is implemented by actually calling a
separate script.

The script will be called with one argument describing action that
just happened. A JSON-encoded object will be passed to standard input
to provide more information about the event. At the very least, the
object will contain a "compose_id" key.

The notification script inherits working directory from the parent
process and it can be called from the same directory "pungi-koji" is
called from. The working directory is listed at the start of main log.

Currently these messages are sent:

   * "status-change" – when composing starts, finishes or fails; a
     "status" key is provided to indicate details

   * "phase-start" – on start of a phase

   * "phase-stop" – when phase is finished

   * "createiso-targets" – with a list of images to be created

   * "createiso-imagedone" – when any single image is finished

   * "createiso-imagefail" – when any single image fails to create

   * "fail-to-start" – when there are incorrect CLI options or errors
     in configuration file; this message does not contain "compose_id"
     nor is it started in the compose directory (which does not exist
     yet)

   * "ostree" – when a new commit is created, this message will
     announce its hash and the name of ref it is meant for.

For phase related messages "phase_name" key is provided as well.

A "pungi-fedmsg-notification" script is provided and understands this
interface.


Setting it up
=============

The script should be provided as a command line argument "--
notification-script".
